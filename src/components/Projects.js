    description: `An application for a grocery mart that lets users browse and shop while also enabling managers to control and manipulate inventory data. Built this web-based application with a microservice architecture. The backend is a Java Gradle project that uses SpringBoot and is complete with Javadocs and Swagger documentation for the REST APIs. Used PostgreSQL as the Database. Made use of Redis for caching and Log4j for logging. Integrated social/google sign-in. Based on whether itâ€™s a customer or manager, the access level changes, giving way to a different UI and enabling different functionality. Deployed the project on the Azure cloud and enabled CI/CD through GitHub workflows.`,
